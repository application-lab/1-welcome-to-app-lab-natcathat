# Something About Me
Hi! My name is Jingchen Xiao and you can also cal me Natsha. I study at NYUSH in Shanghai, China. I am an outgoing girl who is always full of energy and willing to try something new. I enjoy doing a lot of things, reading, singing, dancing and watching movies, frequently taking care of animals. I get huge procrastination thing, which results in screw things up when I first try them and submit this assignment so late. But most of the times I can fix the problems in process and end up doing fine. Perhaps my personality helps me a lot! 

# About the Future
I plan to major Social Science and IMA. I find the methods we apply when studying IMA a great tool to improve academic research, which together with my passion for IMA and programming urges me to take this course. Though I know just a little about this field, I would work harder in the future to live up to my goal. Itâ€™s just so glad that I can enjoy the process with every one of you!
